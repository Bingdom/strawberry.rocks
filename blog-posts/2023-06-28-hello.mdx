I can't believe it's been more than 3 years since
[I wrote a roadmap for Strawberry v1.0](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/issues/268)!
A lot has happened since then, and I think we are pretty much ready to release
v1.0!

I've been always a bit reluctant to release v1.0, because I wanted to make sure
that the library was stable enough, but also had a lot of cool features. While I
think there are still a lot of cool features that we can add, I think it's time
to release v1.0 ðŸ˜Š

## What's new?

### New website

You're probably seeing it right now! We have a new website, I hope you like the
new design! While our old website was pretty cool, I've been feeling like it was
becoming old and stale, so with the help of
[Roll Studio](https://rollstudio.co.uk/) we've been working on a new website. I
think it is pretty rad! Checkout the dark mode too, I usually don't like dark
mode, but I think ours looks amazing!

### Better typing support

We just released support for using `Annotated` with union types, which means
that now you don't get any errors with Pyright or MyPy when using unions:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Union

import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Error:
    message: str

UserOrError = Annotated[Union[User, Error], strawberry.union(name="UserOrError")]

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user_or_error(self) -> UserOrError:
        return User(name="Patrick")
```

<Note>

You can use unions without `strawberry.union` too, but the name will be
generated from the type name, while `strawberry.union` allows you to specify a
custom name.

</Note>

On top of that [Thiago](https://github.com/bellini666) spent a lot of time to
make sure that we support `from __future__ import annotations`, `Generics` and
more! (Thank you!)

### Field extensions

Field extensions are a new feature that allows you to add custom behaviour when
defining a field. Here's an example that implements caching and also adds a
directive on a field:

```python
import time
import strawberry
from strawberry.extensions import FieldExtension
from strawberry.schema_directive import Location
from strawberry.field import StrawberryField


@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.FIELD_DEFINITION])
class Cached:
    time: int = 100


class CachingExtension(FieldExtension):
    def __init__(self, caching_time=100):
        self.caching_time = caching_time
        self.last_cached = 0.0
        self.cached_result = None

    def apply(self, field: StrawberryField) -> None:
        field.directives.append(Cached(time=self.caching_time))

    def resolve(
        self, next_: Callable[..., Any], source: Any, info: Info, **kwargs
    ) -> Any:
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_cached + self.caching_time > current_time:
            return self.cached_result
        self.cached_result = next_(source, info, **kwargs)
        return self.cached_result
```

This feature was contributed by [Erik](https://github.com/erikwrede)! (Thank
you!)

### Relay

Yet another feature contributed by [Thiago](https://github.com/bellini666)! We
now have support for Relay-style pagination, which means that you can implement
pagination with just a few lines of code:

```python

# short example here
```

## What's next?

New playground... Pydantic integration

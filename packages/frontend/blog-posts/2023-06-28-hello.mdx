I can't believe it's been more than 3 years since
[I wrote a roadmap for Strawberry v1.0](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/issues/268)!
A lot has happened since then, and I think we are pretty much ready to release
v1.0!

I've been always a bit reluctant to release v1.0, because I wanted to make sure
that the library was stable enough, but also had a lot of cool features. While I
think there are still a lot of cool features that we can add, I think it's time
to release v1.0 ðŸ˜Š

## What's new?

### New website

You're probably seeing it right now! We have a new website, I hope you like the
new design! While our old website was pretty cool, I've been feeling like it was
becoming old and stale, so with the help of
[Roll Studio](https://rollstudio.co.uk/) we've been working on a new website. I
think it is pretty rad! Checkout the dark mode too, I usually don't like dark
mode, but I think ours looks amazing!

### Better typing support

We just released support for using `Annotated` with union types, which means
that now you don't get any errors with Pyright or MyPy when using unions:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Union

import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Error:
    message: str

UserOrError = Annotated[Union[User, Error], strawberry.union(name="UserOrError")]

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user_or_error(self) -> UserOrError:
        return User(name="Patrick")
```

<Note>

You can use unions without `strawberry.union` too, but the name will be
generated from the type name, while `strawberry.union` allows you to specify a
custom name.

</Note>

On top of that [Thiago](https://github.com/bellini666) spent a lot of time to
make sure that we support `__future__` annotations, `Generics` and more! (Thank
you!)

### Field extensions

Field extensions are a new feature that allows you to add custom behaviour when
defining a field. Here's an example that implements caching and also adds a
directive on a field:

```python
import time
import strawberry
from strawberry.extensions import FieldExtension
from strawberry.schema_directive import Location
from strawberry.field import StrawberryField


@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.FIELD_DEFINITION])
class Cached:
    time: int = 100


class CachingExtension(FieldExtension):
    def __init__(self, caching_time=100):
        self.caching_time = caching_time
        self.last_cached = 0.0
        self.cached_result = None

    def apply(self, field: StrawberryField) -> None:
        field.directives.append(Cached(time=self.caching_time))

    def resolve(
        self, next_: Callable[..., Any], source: Any, info: Info, **kwargs
    ) -> Any:
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_cached + self.caching_time > current_time:
            return self.cached_result
        self.cached_result = next_(source, info, **kwargs)
        return self.cached_result
```

This feature was contributed by [Erik](https://github.com/erikwrede)! (Thank
you!)

### Relay

Yet another feature contributed by [Thiago](https://github.com/bellini666)! We
now have support for Relay-style pagination, which means that you can implement
pagination with just a few lines of code:

```python
...
# short example here
```

### Codemods

I want Strawberry to be as easy to use as possible, and I think that includes
making it easy to upgrade to latest versions, **especially** when we introduce
breaking changes. We do have a generous deprecation policy, so you you this have
plenty of time to upgrade, but we want to make this process as easy as possible.

This is why we've been working on supporting codemods, with a new command called
`strawberry upgrade`. This command will allow you run a specific codemod (and in
future all of them) on your codebase. We only have a codemod to update from the
old union syntax to the new one, but we'll potentially add more in the future.

## What's next?

I'm sure you want to know what's coming next! There's a lot I want to build for
Strawberry, but here's some of them:

### New playground

We have an amazing [playground for Strawberry](https://play.strawberry.rocks)
which allows you to try out Strawberry directly in the browsers. I want to
update it with a new design (in line with the new website) and add new features,
like integration with our docs (imagine clicking on a button on one of the
snippets and going directly to the playground to try that feature).

### API docs

This is something I've been wanting for ages, at the moment we do have some sort
of API docs, but they are added manually in the documentation code. I think it
would be great to have a way to generate them automatically, I know there are
some tools that can help with this, so hopefully we can get this done at some
point.

### Pydantic integration

We have an experimental integration for Pydantic, but we've been thinking about
a "first class" integration for a while. I think it would be great! Imagine
being able to just do this:

```python
@strawberry.type
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: List[int] = []
```

You'd get a GraphQL type from the Pydantic model, with all the Pydantic features
ðŸ˜Š

It will take a bit of time to figure this out properly, but I think it would be
a great addition to Strawberry! There's an
[issue here](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/issues/2181) if
you want to follow the progress.
